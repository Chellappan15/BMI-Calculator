# BMI-Calculator
This is a normal BMI calculator which is made up of basic frontend development Languages comprising of HTML, CSS, Javascript
In this calculator you will be prompted to enter your height in meters and weight in kgs.
The output will be displayed in the right side whether you are having a normal BMI or you are underweight or you are overweight along with some suggestions correspondingly.
I hav also uploaded a simple video of the BMI Calculator on how it runs in the file BMI Calculator.mp4.
Thank you...
